# Pricing and promotion Optimization for Grocery retail store
## Introduction
Paully Pet store is a growing store that delivers their goods all over Nigeria and are being faced with low profit margins and a slow-down in repeat purchases. Leadership suspect that the discount strategies being used by the company is under-cutting profitablibity and are hereby seeking a data-driven approach that will increase sales, pricing, bundling, and promotions.

With SQL, I performed an EDA to gather information about the performance health of the business and a detailed analysis to identify patterns in customer behaviour, margin contribution, and bundle effectiveness that will lead to clear, actionable plans.

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of the sales and customers data. The tasks to be completed are:
- Explore the data to determine the total revenue generated by each product and the product category.
- Explore the sales trend to determine the total sales, COGS and profit over time.
- Explore the sales trend to determine the peak month
- Perform a part-to-whole analysis to determine which productcategory and productsubcategory contribute to the overall sales
- Explore the data to determine the relationship between the various bundles, promo strategies, and profitability.
- Explore the data to determine the profitable products and cities with the most customers.
- Create a markdown file for deployment.
- Host on the code on Guithub or Gitlab.

## Research Questions
1. Determine the total revenue generated by each product.
2. Determine the total revenue generated by each product category.
3. Calculate the total sales, COGS, AND Profit over time.
4. Which month had the highest sales or the peak month?
5. Which productcategory & subcategories contribute to the overall sales?
6. Calculate the top 5 products with the highest gross margins.
7. How do discount vs volume deal promotions impact promo uplift?
8. Which promotion type results in higher AOV (Average Order Value)?
9. Which products drive the most add-on purchases (attach rate)?
10. How does Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) vary across cities?
11. Which bundles strike the best tradeoff between profit margin and customer perception?

## About the Dataset

## Data Analysis Using SQL Generated Queries
1. Determine the total revenue generated by each product
```sql
SELECT 
       ProductID,
       ProductName,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercentage / 100.0)) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [Customer transactions]
GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
```
2. Determine the total revenue generated by each product category
```
SELECT 
	ProductCategory,
	ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice * (1-DiscountPercentage /100)),2) AS Revenue
FROM [Customer transactions]
GROUP BY ProductCategory
```
3. Calculate the total sales, COGS, and Profit over time
```
SELECT 
	YEAR(TransactionDate)  AS trans_year,
	SUM(CostPrice * Quantity) AS COGS,
	ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice * (1- DiscountPercentage/100)),2) AS Sales
FROM [Customer transactions]
GROUP BY Year(TransactionDate)
```
4. Which month had the highest sales or the peak month?
```
SELECT 
	  DATENAME(MONTH, TransactionDate) AS Month,

  FROM dbo.[Customer transactions]
  GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, TransactionDate) 
  ORDER BY TotalSales DESC 
```
5. Which productcategory & subcategories contribute to the overall sales?
```
WITH SUBCATEGORY_SALES AS (

	ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice *(1- DiscountPercentage /100)),2) AS total_sales
FROM [Customer transactions]
GROUP BY ProductCategory, ProductSubcategory
)
SELECT TOP 5
    ProductCategory,
	ProductSubcategory,
	total_sales,
	SUM(total_sales) OVER () OverallSales,
	CONCAT(ROUND((CAST(total_sales AS FLOAT)/ SUM(total_sales) OVER ()) * 100, 2), '%') Percent_total
	FROM SUBCATEGORY_SALES
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC
```
6. Calculate the Products that are the top 5 highest gross margins
```
WITH Gross_Margin_Calculation AS (
SELECT 
	ProductID,
	ProductName,
	SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity *  (1 - DiscountPercentage/100)) AS Revenue,

FROM [Customer transactions]
GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName
)
SELECT TOP 5
	ProductID,
	ProductName,
	ROUND(AVG((Revenue - COGS )/Revenue), 2) AS Gross_margin_percent
FROM Gross_Margin_Calculation
GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName
ORDER BY Gross_margin_percent DESC
```
7. Comparing the performance in Revenue between the different promo types to the baseline sales to determine promo uplift.
```
WITH Baseline_Revenue AS (
SELECT 
	SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 - DiscountPercentage /100)) AS Baseline_rev
FROM [Customer transactions]

FROM [Customer transactions]
GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName
