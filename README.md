# Pricing and promotion Optimization for Grocery retail store
## Introduction
Paully Pet store is a growing store that delivers their goods all over Nigeria and are being faced with low profit margins and a slow-down in repeat purchases. Leadership suspect that the discount strategies being used by the company is under-cutting profitablibity and are hereby seeking a data-driven approach that will increase sales, pricing, bundling, and promotions.

With SQL, I performed an EDA to gather information about the performance health of the business and a detailed analysis to identify patterns in customer behaviour, margin contribution, and bundle effectiveness that will lead to clear, actionable plans.

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of the sales and customers data. The tasks to be completed are:
- Explore the data to determine the total revenue generated by each product and the product category.
- Explore the sales trend to determine the total sales, COGS and profit over time.
- Explore the sales trend to determine the peak month
- Perform a part-to-whole analysis to determine which productcategory and productsubcategory contribute to the overall sales
- Explore the data to determine the relationship between the various bundles, promo strategies, and profitability.
- Explore the data to determine the profitable products and cities with the most customers.
- Create a markdown file for deployment.
- Host on the code on Guithub or Gitlab.
