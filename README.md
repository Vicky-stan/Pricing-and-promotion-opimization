# Pricing and promotion Optimization for Grocery retail store
## Introduction
Paully Pet store is a growing store that delivers their goods all over Nigeria and are being faced with low profit margins and a slow-down in repeat purchases. Leadership suspect that the discount strategies being used by the company is under-cutting profitablibity and are hereby seeking a data-driven approach that will increase sales, pricing, bundling, and promotions.

With SQL, I performed an EDA to gather information about the performance health of the business and a detailed analysis to identify patterns in customer behaviour, margin contribution, and bundle effectiveness that will lead to clear, actionable plans.

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of the sales and customers data. The tasks to be completed are:
- Explore the data to determine the total revenue generated by each product and the product category.
- Explore the sales trend to determine the total sales, COGS and profit over time.
- Explore the sales trend to determine the peak month
- Perform a part-to-whole analysis to determine which productcategory and productsubcategory contribute to the overall sales
- Explore the data to determine the relationship between the various bundles, promo strategies, and profitability.
- Explore the data to determine the profitable products and cities with the most customers.
- Create a markdown file for deployment.
- Host on the code on Guithub or Gitlab.

## Research Questions
1. Determine the total revenue generated by each product.
2. Determine the total revenue generated by each product category.

## Recommendation
1. Inventory & Product Availability Strategy:
   - For the top 5 products that generate the most revenue, the following should be implemented;
      - Ensure consistent restocking of top-performing products to avoid stockouts.
      - Use demand forecasting models to predict and proactively meet inventory needs, especially before peak months (e.g., November).
      - Bundle mid-performers with top performers (e.g., pair Laptop Force with Trousers Song) to increase sales of less popular items.
     
3. Product Category Focus:
   - Electronics dominate sales; top subcategories include laptops and smartphones. recommendations include;
      - Invest more in marketing and visibility for high-performing categories like Electronics and Home Appliances.

By identifying top revenue-generating products and categories, evaluating promotional effectiveness, and uncovering regional trends in customer lifetime value, we’ve highlighted clear opportunities to optimize pricing strategies, streamline inventory management, and improve marketing focus. 

## Glossary of Terms
- Average Order Value (AOV): A key metric in e-commerce that represents the average amount of money customers spend per order over a specific period, It helps businesses understand customer purchasing behavior and optimize pricing, marketing, and product strategies. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total orders within a specific period of time.

- Attach Rate: Attach Rate is a metric that measures how often an additional product or service (typically an accessory, add-on, or complementary item) is sold in relation to a primary product.
It Helps track cross-sell effectiveness, indicates customer buying behavior and drives strategies for bundling or upselling.

- Bundles: Bundles refer to a marketing and sales strategy where multiple products or services are packaged together and sold as a single combined unit—usually at a discounted price compared to buying each item separately.

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV) is the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer over the entire duration of their relationship with the company. It’s a critical metric that helps businesses understand how valuable a customer is not just on a single purchase, but across all interactions over time.


- Discounts: are reductions in the original selling price of a product or service, used to encourage customers to make a purchase. They're a common marketing and pricing strategy to drive sales volume, clear inventory, reward loyalty, or attract new customers.
   
- Revenue: Revenue is the total amount of money a business earns from its normal operations mainly through the sale of goods or services before any expenses are deducted.

- Gross Margin: Gross Margin is a profitability metric that shows how much money a business keeps after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue. It tells you how efficiently a company is producing or sourcing its products.

- COGS: stands for Cost of Goods Sold, and it represents the direct costs of producing or purchasing the products a business sells during a specific period.
